# automater

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of automater is to automate boring stuff using R with various packages. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of automater.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("matutosi/automater")
```

## Example

See vignettes. 

https://github.com/matutosi/automater/tree/main/vignettes


<!-- 
You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. 
`devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. 
You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. 
An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
